# Breast-Cancer-Detection
A complete Machine Learning pipeline to predict breast cancer using a labeled dataset. This project covers loading data, cleaning, EDA, model training with scikit-learn, and performance evaluation. Implemented using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

# Breast Cancer Detection

This project is a simple machine learning pipeline to detect breast cancer using a dataset.  
It includes:
- Data loading
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation

## Files
- `Breast_Cancer.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the entire code.
- `data.csv` — Dataset used for analysis and model building.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about tumors (such as radius, texture, smoothness) and labels whether they are malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `Breast_Cancer.ipynb`.
2. Upload `data.csv` when prompted (or place it in the same directory).
3. Run all cells to reproduce the results.

## Project Goal
The goal is to accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign using machine learning models.
